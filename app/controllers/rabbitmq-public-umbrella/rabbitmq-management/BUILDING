You may not need to build this yourself. Find binaries at:
        http://www.rabbitmq.com/plugins.html#rabbitmq-management

This is a normal RabbitMQ plugin. For detailed installation instructions
go to:
        http://www.rabbitmq.com/admin-guide.html#installing-plugins

(NOTE: it seems to be problematic to build rabbitmq-mochiweb on Windows.)

Summary
-------

RabbitMQ plugins tend to be tightly bound to a given version of
RabbitMQ. To build all the plugins for RabbitMQ version X.Y.Z:

    hg clone http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-public-umbrella/
    cd rabbitmq-public-umbrella
    hg update rabbitmq_vX_Y_Z
    make checkout
    make BRANCH=rabbitmq_vX_Y_Z named_update
    make

If you are running RabbitMQ built from default, you can skip the two
update steps.

After that, in the directory 'rabbitmq-public-umbrella/rabbitmq-management' you
should be able to see the plugins:

    $ ls dist
    amqp_client.ez    rabbitmq-management           rabbitmq-mochiweb.ez
    mochiweb.ez       rabbitmq-management-agent.ez  webmachine.ez
    rabbit_common.ez  rabbitmq-management.ez

To install them to a local RabbitMQ instance you need to copy all of the *.ez
files into your rabbit plugins directory *except* rabbit_common.ez.

For example:

    cp rabbitmq-mochiweb.ez mochiweb.ez webmachine.ez \
        amqp_client.ez rabbitmq-management.ez rabbitmq-management-agent.ez \
        /usr/lib/rabbitmq/lib/rabbitmq_server-2.0.0/plugins

Finally, restart RabbitMQ.
